/** = Description
  * The constructor of HControl implements the same model as HView,
  * but accepts a third parameter: the options object, that contain
  * optional properties, like the value and events.
  *
  * = Parameters
  * +_rect+::     An instance of +HRect+, defines the position and size of views.
  *               It can be also defined with an array, see below.
  * +_parent+::   The parent instance this instance will be contained within.
  *               A valid parent can be another HView compatible instance,
  *               an HApplication instance, a HControl or a similar extended
  *               HView instance. The origin of the +_rect+ is the same as the
  *               parent's offset. For HApplication instances, the web browser's
  *               window's left top corner is the origin.
  * +_options+:: Optional, all other parameters as object attributes.
  *              Defaults to an instance of +HControlDefaults+, see controlDefaults
  *
  * == The +_rect+ dimensions as arrays
  * Instead of an instance of +HRect+, dimensions can also be supplied as arrays.
  * The array length must be either 4 or 6. If the length is 4, the dimensions are
  * specified as follows: +[ x, y, width, height ]+. Note that this is different
  * from the construction parameters of +HRect+ that takes the coordinates as two
  * points, like: +( left, top, right, bottom )+.
  * Arrays with 6 items are a bit more complex (and powerful) as they can specify
  * the flexible offsets too.
  *
  * === The array indexes for a +_rect+ configured as an 4-item array:
  * Always left/top aligned, all items must be specified.
  * Index::            Description
  * +0+::              The X-coordinate (measured from the parent's left edge)
  * +1+::              The Y-coordinate (measured from the parent's top edge)
  * +2+::              The width.
  * +3+::              The height.
  *
  * === The array indexes a +_rect+ configured as an 6-item array:
  * Can be any configuration of left/top/right/bottom alignment and supports
  * flexible widths. At least 4 items must be specified.
  * Index::            Description
  * +0+::              The left-aligned X-coordinate or +null+ if the view is
  *                    right-aligned and using a right-aligned X-coordinate at
  *                    index +4+ as well as the width specified at index +2+.
  * +1+::              The top-aligned Y-coordinate or +null+ if the view is
  *                    bottom-aligned and using a right-aligned X-coordinate at
  *                    index +5+ as well as the height specified at index +3+.
  * +2+::              The width, if only one X-coordinate specifies the
  *                    position (at indexes +0+ or +4+).
  *                    If both X-coordinates (at indexes +0+ and +4+) are
  *                    specified, the width can be specified with a +null+ for
  *                    automatic (flexible) width. If the width is specified,
  *                    it's used as the minimum width.
  * +3+::              The height, if only one Y-coordinate specifies the
  *                    position (at indexes +1+ or +5+).
  *                    If both Y-coordinates (at indexes +1+ and +5+) are
  *                    specified, the height can be specified with a +null+ for
  *                    automatic (flexible) height. if the height is specified,
  *                    it's used as the minimum height.
  * +4+::              The right-aligned X-coordinate or +null+ if the view is
  *                    left-aligned and using a left-aligned X-coordinate at
  *                    index +0+ as well as the width specified at index +2+.
  * +5+::              The bottom-aligned Y-coordinate or +null+ if the view is
  *                    top-aligned and using a top-aligned X-coordinate at
  *                    index +1+ as well as the height specified at index +3+.
  * == Usage examples of +_rect+:
  * Specified as two instances of +HPoint+,
  * x: 23, y: 75, width: 200, height: 100:
  *  HRect.nu( HPoint.nu( 23, 75 ), HPoint.nu( 223, 175 ) )
  *
  * The same as above, but without +HPoint+ instances:
  *  HRect.nu( 23, 75, 223, 175 )
  *
  * The same as above, but with an array as the constructor
  * parameter for +HRect+:
  *  HRect.nu( [ 23, 75, 223, 175 ] )
  *
  * The same as above, but with an array instead of a +HRect+ instance:
  *  [ 23, 75, 200, 100 ]
  *
  * The same as above, but with a 6-item array:
  *  [ 23, 75, 200, 100, null, null ]
  *
  * The same as above, but aligned to the right instead of left:
  *  [ null, 75, 200, 100, 23, null ]
  *
  * The same as above, but aligned to the right/bottom edges:
  *  [ null, null, 200, 100, 23, 75 ]
  *
  * The same as above, but aligned to the left/bottom edges:
  *  [ 23, null, 200, 100, null, 75 ]
  *
  * Flexible width (based on the parent's dimensions):
  *  [ 23, 75, null, 100, 23, null ]
  *
  * Flexible height (based on the parent's dimensions):
  *  [ 23, 75, 200, null, null, 75 ]
  *
  * Flexible width and height (based on the parent's dimensions):
  *  [ 23, 75, null, null, 23, 75 ]
  *
  * Flexible width and height, but limited to a minimum width
  * of 200 and a minimum height of 100 (based on the parent's dimensions):
  *  [ 23, 75, 200, 100, 23, 75 ]
  *
  * == The +_options+ Object, all options are optional and default to what's
  * defined in +controlDefaults+.
  * Key::         Description
  * +value+::     The initial value of the component. It's type and meaning
  *               differs between components.

  *
  * == Event States
  * Event State::    Description
  * +mouseMove+::   The global +mouseMove+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event regardless if it's focused or not. The event
  *                 responder method for it is +mouseMove+ and it receives the
  *                 absolute x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer when the
  *                 mouse cursor position changes. Can also be toggled
  *                 separately by using the +setMouseMove+ method.
  * +textEnter+::   The global +textEnter+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event regardless if it's focused or not. The event
  *                 responder method for it is +textEnter+ and it receives a
  *                 every time a key on the keyboard is pressed. Can also
  *                 be toggled separately by using the +setTextEnter+ method.
  * +click+::       The local +click+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +click+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be

  * +mouseDown+::   The local +mouseDown+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseDown+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setMouseDown+ method.
  * +mouseUp+::     The local +mouseUp+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseUp+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setMouseUp+ method.
  * +mouseWheel+::  The local +mouseWheel+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseWheel+ and it receives the delta of
  *                 the amount of the mouse scroll wheel was rolled: a floating
  *                 point number, larger or smaller than 0, depending on the
  *                 direction the scroll wheel was rolled. Can also be

  * +keyDown+::     The local +keyDown+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +keyDown+ and it receives the ascii key
  *                 code whenever a keyboard key is pressed. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setKeyDown+ method.

  * +keyUp+::       The local +keyUp+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +keyUp+ and it receives the ascii key
  *                 code whenever a keyboard key is released. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setKeyUp+ method.
