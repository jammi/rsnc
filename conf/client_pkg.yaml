  # The format is package name (eg core makes core.js) as the key and
  # a list of values of bundles to include in that package, in the order
  # to include; mind the dependency order.
  #
  # The syntax of it is a list of items with full or partial
  # path or just the bundle name, but all of these should be unique.
  #
  # There are special annotiations for a few purposes:
  #
  # This deletes the included bundle from the named package;
  # useful in project client_pkgs.yaml files, where you might want to
  # override the defaults.
  # - delete: bundlename

  # This includes a yaml file, basically converting it to JSON, then
  # including it in a JS bundle exporting a clone of its value.

  # Same as above, but for JSON:
  # - file: sourcepath/sourcename.json

  # handle the exporting themselves.
